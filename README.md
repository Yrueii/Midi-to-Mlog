# Midi-to-Mlog
convert midi files into JS Script which you can paste into the in-game's console to make and set codes of World Processor

uses the new Play Sound instruction in BE

This is my first time creating something like this, its definitely not perfect and has many mistakes that maybe i didn't even know, but everyone got to start somewhere, i don't recommend anyone to reverse engineer this.
if you have any question you can ask me directly on discord (Yruei)

now that i think about it creating a website/ a mod is probably more accesible than creating an exe

# My Antivirus blocked it from running!
its an unsigned exe app, windows will block every unsigned exe app from running,
the choices to run it is up to you,

if you have python run the .py script instead if you're uncomfortable
